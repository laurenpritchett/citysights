# City Sights

City Sights is a web app that makes it easier for users to plan where they will take photos in a given city before traveling there. Users can search the city they will visit and see the most interesting photos taken in that city from the Flickr API. When they select a photo that they like, they will see the photo location and a Google map with directions from their chosen starting address. Users can save photo locations to their profile and remove them if they have a change of heart.
